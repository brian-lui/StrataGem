# Permissible font sizes: "big", "medium", "small"
# Big takes up 3 rows of space. Medium takes up 2 rows. Small takes up 1 row.
# Currently we have enough space to comfortably display 6 rows in vs_quotes
#
# #Hash symbol indicates a comment, will not be parsed
# blank lines also will not be parsed
# `Backtick indiates a new section
# *Asterisk indicates a new sub-section
#
# Each quote has 3 parts:
# --- indicates new quote
# next line, big/medium/small indicates font size
# next line is the quote itself
# repeat these two
