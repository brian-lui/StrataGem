# StrataGem

Hey everyone! This is our team's game.

We're too poor to afford private hosting and too technically unsavvy to use Mercurial or whatever. So the source code and art assets are available to everyone. Sad!

Eventually this will become private when it gets closer to release I guess.

Debug mode is enabled by default for our convenience. If you're coming from elsewhere and want to turn it off, edit main.lua and change line 16 to "local DEMO_MODE_ON = true".

Anyway this is in Love2D 0.10. If this looks fun please e-mail me. Let's e-mail!
