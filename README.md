# StrataGem

Hey everyone! This is the current project for Hardly Working Games.

Eventually this will become private when it gets closer to release, but in the meantime please enjoy playing this game for free!

Debug mode is enabled by default. If you're coming from elsewhere and want to turn it off, press **"z"** in the game screen to toggle it.

Anyway this is in Love2D 11.1.

## How to play

3. Download the master zip file [here](https://github.com/brian-lui/StrataGem/archive/master.zip)
4. Unzip the file, it will be unzipped to the folder StrataGem-master
